The University of Botswana is currently very behind in the use of technology. The university has a very large population of people and yet booking is done manually which is very tiresome and time consuming it uses old methods of doing things and therefore it is very important for us as students to come up with technological ideas which will be implemented in the university. This document in helping achieve the goal of seeing University of Botswana being a smart campus. Through this project we are making the room booking of the university to be digitalized.

### INTRODUCTION
The process of booking rooms in the University of Botswana has always been done manually. This is very tiresome and time consuming since there is no proper and convenient application to do this. To deal with the problem of lack of an application which books rooms we will be creating an application that automates it. Online room booking application for the University of Botswana .This will help provide for an efficient and convenient way of reserving rooms for the users involved. The entire room booking flow will not be affected by the absence of responsible individual who are currently the security officers Online room booking application will also help in a more secure and easy to manage way of storing information as it will be stored in a database. It is high time for university Of Botswana to start moving into the 4th industrial resolution as it is the biggest university in the country and for this change to happen they should start in the University of Botswana.
### OBJECTIVE
	To be able to book a room
	To display room booking information
	To give update user with time left in the allocated
	To give user extend booking option
### SCOPE
This application will be used by the students and staff of the University of Botswana. It works on smartphones and it can be used anytime and anywhere. There are no information systems that are currently being implemented and the UB Faculty Booking will be replacing the old reservation system which is currently being implemented manually by people, building admins. The UB Faculty Booking will aim to be self-contained, meaning that it will have no dependencies to other existing information system. 

### LITERATURE REVIEW
According to EAZY  BOOKING  is  an  tourist  agent  which  provides  the  facilities  for  booking  hotels,  inns, houses,  holiday  apartments  and  other  accommodations’  for  customers.  They operate their business in Malaysia, Singapore and other South East Asia. Any customers need to book hotel, inns or apartment they need to visit their office which is situated in Bukit Jalil for checking the availability as well as negotiation.  Recently they have decided to change their booking pattern from manual to web based system. It will help them to manage the customers booking easily and also to keep the customers data more safe. It will also help staffs to keep in track their customer’s online booking request as well as easily to reply feedback to the customers. For that they hired a developer to build the web system for this reputed company. In this documentation it shows how the web based system will be implemented and looks like (User Interface) (Hasan, November 2014).
Nowadays, technology has changed many aspects of life and people’s daily life is becoming indivisible 
From the network due to the development of Internet. With online dentist reservation system, the process gets much faster and more efficient than traditional way. Thousands of business and organizations have already discovered  the  advantage  gained  by  using  the  online  reservation  system .Online  dentist  reservation  system allows the system administer to access and manage the database online, quickly pull data and create strong  reports  right  from  the  online  reservation  system  with  most  practical  to  find  the  fastest  information, instead of having to maintain and manage separate data files, folders and spreadsheets. They simply navigate to the system just as any Web Site.  The data will be housed securely and safely online (Chutisant Kerdvibulvech+, Nwe Ni Win, 2012).

### PROS
Those booking online can easily access to the list of hotel and choose between them the one, which is convenient to them at the same time. The availability of the hotel rooms and the facilities provided by them can be known and compared with the other hotels. They can then book any starred hotel as they wish, just by clicking the button, sitting at home, office, or anywhere else, provided you can access the internet.

Secondly, the internet has established links between large hotel companies' right from five-star hotels to any other hotels which has made very flexible on the internet for individuals to make a complete planning of their holidays or any other commitments.

### CONS
There are of course some disadvantages too besides the advantages. Whenever you have to do the booking, you have to give them your name and address as well as the bank or credit card details, which are the most disadvantageous factor, which is the most attractive target for the cyber criminals. There are also fake websites created for stolen personal details that is supposed to be the prevailing danger. In the process of online booking, there is no intermingling of any person to deal with to understand the terms and conditions.

The University of the Western Cape (UWC) has decided that by 2010, the entire student registration process will be online. This vision implies that the student accommodation system should also be computerized and possibly become online based. The current accommodation application process involves students to fill a paper-based application form which takes a long time to process. The Student Residence Management System (SRMS) is introduced as a computerized system to ease the pressure on students and administrators. The new residence application system will help to eliminate the paper-based applications thereby speeding up processing as details will be captured in the database. This will help to eliminate the delays caused by the sequential checking of each residence for the availability of rooms. The system will check automatically for the available rooms to help accelerate the room allocation process thus making it painless for the managers to allocate rooms to students. At the present time, students must check for the successful or unsuccessful list of accommodation application at the residence administrator. Since the new system to be adopted is computerized, it will automatically send notifications to successful and unsuccessful applicants through email.
